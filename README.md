# coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data-project

# This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory

Load the activity and feature info

Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation

Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

From the result data set , creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
